    <p>Digitapes is an open-source, open-design, personal media system to 
    protect and cherish your favourite memories.</p>

    <p>By establishing a <em>"digitapes standard"</em> - any digitapes compatible services can 
    be used to create, store, transmit, preserve, montage or print out your photo and 
    video albums from your phone.</p>

    <p> You can get involved by checking out our github repository, where the code
    and discussions take place.

    <h2> The digitapes system </h2>
    <p>
    You can create and store a digitape anywhere, then use it for any compatible service. 
    We are currently building a phone app for easy "share to" functionality, as well as 
    DIY roll-it-yourself storage options.
    </p>

    <p>
    With just the open source app and DIY-storage, you and your friends can all share 
    photos and videos of a holiday together, just like you'd share photos in messenger. 
    That digitape can then be sent to a photo-album service to be made into a physical 
    thing, or a simple online montage service will put it to music and upload it to 
    youtube. Easy as the click of a button.
    </p>

    <h2>Interconnecting services</h2>
    <p>
    There is also the possibility for you to run a digitape service for others. 
    For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once you create a digitape, you could send it to some digital archival 
        service, who could burn it onto DVD for you.</li>
      <li>There could also be a service that would turn all your historic photos
        and videos into a digitape.</li>
      <li>A service could take a digitape and turn it into a montage to host it 
        on youtube.</li>
      <li>A different service might make the same digitape into a slideshow that 
        you can share with friends and family.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> The goal of Digitapes is to provide a standard protocol that interconnecting 
    systems can interact with. This means
    A tape produced from one service can be used in any other service. The data is 
    yours and should not be locked into any particular offering.
    </p>

    <h2> Why digitapes </h2>
    <p> Digitapes exists for two reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> To make it easier to create and share photo albums, with others, that are 
        about a particular topic. </li>
      <li> To make it easier to use and preserve those photo albums, in creating and 
        sharing things such as montages, photo albums, digital archives, and the like.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Digitapes arose from finding it difficult to correlate photos based on a topic 
    (such as a birth of a child, or a family holiday) across
    different devices and different cloud services.</p>
    <p> Many phone services (such as Google Photos, or iCloud) work on a "camera roll" 
    principle: every photo you take is stored, and later, catergorised into certain 
    topics. This can lead to false positives (ie: wrong images making their way into 
    albums) and also includes vendor lock in with the cloud provider.</p>
    <p>
    After digging out some old super-8 and VHS tapes from the attic and watching 
    childhood memories, we've realised that we need a similar open standard that can 
    preserve and collate photos and video from our current generation, into the future.
